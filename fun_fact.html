            <p>The far side of the Moon, known to the public as "The Dark Side of the Moon," is the lunar hemisphere that always faces away from Earth.</p>
            <p><em>But why&#x2753;</em></p>
            <p>The Moon always shows the same face to Earth because it is tidally locked, a result of gravitational forces acting over millions of years. This happened due to an imbalance between the Moon's center of mass and its center of gravity, with the near side containing denser materials. Earth's gravity pulled on this mass, gradually slowing the Moon’s rotation until it matched its orbit. As a result, one side remains hidden from view — often called the "dark side," though both sides receive sunlight.</p>

            <p>Exoplanets are like cosmic wildcards—planets that orbit stars far beyond our solar system, each with its own strange personality! Some are scorching hot giants that rain molten glass sideways, while others might be icy worlds orbiting twin suns. Astronomers have already found thousands, and new ones pop up like surprise guests at a galactic party. Who knows? The next Earth—or even alien life—could be hiding on one of these mysterious distant worlds&#127757;!</p>
